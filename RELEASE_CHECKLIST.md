## üöÄ Release Steps

### 1. Final Code Review
```bash
# Review all files
git status
git diff

# Check for any TODOs or FIXMEs
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" src/

# Run build
npm run build

# Test locally
npm start
```

### 2. Update Placeholders

# Search for placeholders
grep -r "yourusername\|your.email\|example.com" .

# Replace with actual values
# - GitHub username in package.json, README.md, etc.
# - Email in SECURITY.md
# - Repository URLs
```

### 3. Create GitHub Repository
1. Create new repository on GitHub
2. Initialize with existing code:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: TidalCycles MCP Server v1.0.0"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/tidal-mcp-server.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Create Release
1. Tag the release:
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

2. Create GitHub Release with notes from CHANGELOG.md

### 5. Announce
- [ ] Post in TidalCycles Discord
- [ ] Post on TOPLAP forum/mailing list
- [ ] Tweet/post on social media
- [ ] Consider posting on:
  - Hacker News
  - Reddit (r/livecoding, r/algorave)
  - Algorithmic music forums

## üìä Success Metrics

Track these after release:
- GitHub stars
- Issues opened/closed
- Community contributions
- Usage reports
- Feature requests

## üîß Post-Release Tasks

### Immediate (Week 1)
- [ ] Monitor issues and respond quickly
- [ ] Fix any critical bugs
- [ ] Update documentation based on user feedback
- [ ] Engage with early adopters

### Short-term (Month 1)

- [ ] Grow contributor base

## üí° Marketing Ideas

### Content
- Demo video showing Claude making music
- Tutorial series on YouTube
- Blog post: "AI-Assisted Live Coding with Claude"
- Showcase at algorave or live coding event

### Community
- Host virtual workshop
- Create Discord server (or channel in existing server)
- Contribute patterns to community library
- Collaborate with TidalCycles maintainers

### Technical
- Submit to Awesome Lists (awesome-livecoding, awesome-mcp)
